# Usage
1. Use main.py to generate a new set of simulation images.
2. Be careful about the input. The number of images must be divisible by the number of nights.
3. After the generation of new images, look over the name of the generated folder "Sim X". Use Header_Generator.py to modify the headers. The input is the label of the folder (i.e. if the new folder is "Sim X" then input X).
